# Object-Oriented Computer Assembly Framework

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of an Object-Oriented Framework for assembling and managing computer components. The framework is designed to model the various parts of a computer, such as the CPU, GPU, motherboard, memory, and other peripherals, in a structured manner. It allows for the creation of both PC and Mac computer assemblies, incorporating different types of components.

The project includes both a header file and a source file for the core logic, as well as UML diagrams and detailed reports to explain the design and structure.

## Features
- **PC and Mac Assembly**: Supports creating both PC and Mac computer assemblies by selecting different CPUs and components.
- **Component Management**: Allows the user to interact with various computer components like CPU, GPU, memory, ports, and more.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to manage the computer components.
- **Port Handling**: Includes support for handling different types of ports like VGI, I/O, USB, and HDMI for connectivity.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key files:

- **ComputerComponents.h**: Contains class definitions for various computer components like CPU, GPU, memory, and ports.
- **ComputerAssembly.cpp**: Implements the logic for computer assembly, including PC and Mac-specific configurations.
- **UML.png**: A UML diagram illustrating the relationships between various components in the system.
- **Computer Assembly Framework Case Study.pdf**: A case study detailing the design and implementation of the framework.
- **Computer Assembly Framework Report.pdf**: A report summarizing the framework and its usage.

## Requirements
This project was developed using the C++ programming language. It should be compatible with any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
